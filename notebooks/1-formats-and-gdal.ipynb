What time was the image acquired? As with Raster data formats there are also myriad metadata formats. NASA has undertaken an effort to consolidate and standardize metadata across decades of observations from hundreds of sensors. This is an extremely important effort and a complicated undertaking that you can read more about here - [NASA's Common Metadata Repository](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr)\n",

This is especially true for interactive web maps where we want to visualize a raster at a resolution appropriate for a given zoom level. If you are looking at the entire globe, there is no reason to render an image at 30m resolution because our eyes can't discern the detail. Conversly if we are zoomed into a city, we want the full resolution data displayed. This schematic illustrates tiling:\n",

There are common standard tiling schemes for web maps - check out the [mercantile library](https://github.com/mapbox/mercantile). GDAL also offers utilities to easily generate tiles from any raster.
